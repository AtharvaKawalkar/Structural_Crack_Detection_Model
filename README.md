# Structural_Crack_Detection_Model

Summary
This project presents a structural crack detection model utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), implemented in Python. The model is designed to accurately identify and classify cracks in various structures, aiding in the maintenance and safety assessment of buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure.

Key Features:
Dataset: Divided into positive (crack) and negative (no crack) categories to facilitate supervised learning.
Deep Learning Approach: Employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high accuracy in crack detection.
Data Augmentation: Uses TensorFlow's data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset and improve model robustness.
Model Training: Utilizes TensorFlow for building and training the CNN model.
Model Optimization: Optimized using TensorFlow Lite for efficient deployment on edge devices.
Backend Server: Built using FastAPI to handle model inference requests and serve the results.
Frontend: Developed with ReactJS, providing a user-friendly interface for uploading images and displaying detection results.
Deployment: The website is deployed on localhost for demonstration and testing purposes.
